In the context of my Meet app, serverless functions can be employed to manage dynamic, event-driven functionalities such as user notifications, real-time updates, or processing user inputs. By using serverless architecture, can ensure that the app scales seamlessly with user demand, maintaining performance without incurring unnecessary costs during periods of low activity. This approach allows for a more responsive, efficient application that optimally utilizes resources, ultimately enhancing the user experience while maintaining operational efficiency!

## My Project Features & Scenarios

### Feature 2: Show/Hide Event Details

**User Story:** As an user,  
I should be able to show or hide details of events,  
So that I can quickly access more information about events I am interested in and keep the interface clean by hiding details of events I am not interested in.

**Scenario 1:** _An event element is collapsed by default._

- **Given** the user has navigated to the events list page
- **When** the page loads
- **Then** each event element is displayed in a collapsed

**Scenario 2:** _User can expand an event to see details._

- **Given** the user is viewing the events list
  - And an event element is in a collapsed state
- **When** the user clicks on the event element
- **Then** the event element expands
  - And the details of the event are displayed

**Scenario 3:** _User can collapse an event to hide details._

- **Given** the user is viewing the events list
  - And an event element is in an expanded state showing details
- **When** the user clicks on the event element again
- **Then** the event element collapses
  - And the details of the event are hidden

### Feature 3: Specify Number of Events

**User Story:** As an user,  
I should be able to specify the number of events I want to view on the page,  
So that I can customize the amount of information presented to me, making it easier to browse through events without feeling overwhelmed.

**Scenario 1:** _When user hasn’t specified a number, 32 events are shown by default._

- **Given** the user has not specified a number of events to view
- **When** the user navigates to the events list page
- **Then** the page displays 32 events by default

**Scenario 2:** _User can change the number of events displayed._

- **Given** the user is on the events list page
- **When** the user specifies a number of events to display
- **Then** the page updates to display that specific number of events

### Feature 4: Use the App When Offline

**User Story:** As an user,  
I should be able to use the app even when I am offline,  
So that I can access event information without needing an internet connection, ensuring I have the details I need at any time.

**Scenario 1:** _Show cached data when there’s no internet connection._

- **Given** the user has previously loaded event data with an internet connection
  - And now the user is without an internet connection
- **When** the user opens the app
- **Then** the app displays the most recently cached event data

**Scenario 2:** _Show error when user changes search settings (city, number of events) without an internet connection._

- **Given** the user is without an internet connection
  - And the user is on the app's event search page
- **When** the user changes the search settings, such as city or number of events
- **Then** the app displays an error message indicating that changing search settings requires an internet connection

### Feature 5: Add an App Shortcut to the Home Screen

**User Story:** As an user,  
I should be able to add a shortcut of the app to my home screen,  
So that I can quickly access the app without having to navigate through my phone’s browser or app list, making it more convenient to use.

**Scenario 1:** _User can install the meet app as a shortcut on their device home screen._

- **Given** the user is on the meet app webpage in their mobile browser
- **When** the user selects the option to add the app to their home screen
- **Then** the app is added as a shortcut on the user's device home screen
  - And the user can launch the meet app directly from their home screen

### Feature 6: Display Charts Visualizing Event Details

**User Story:** As an user,  
I should be able to view charts that visualize event details,  
So that I can easily understand the types of events available, their popularity, and other statistics at a glance, helping me to make informed decisions about which events to attend

**Scenario 1:** _Show a chart with the number of upcoming events in each city._

- **Given** the user is on the dashboard or analytics page where event data is visualized
- **When** the user navigates to the section displaying the number of upcoming events by city
- **Then** the app displays a chart that visualizes the number of upcoming events in each city
  - And the user can interact with the chart to get more detailed information about events in each city
